Gold is a very lame movie. At best it does not bring any feeling thing related to patriotism. 
So let me point out the cons: 1. The acting is very pedestrian. 2. The story line is bad. Actually 
there is no story, this represents a lame copy of chak de ! India. 
So why am i making this claim? Let me tell (Just a few out of the whole lot). 
So let me start with Tapan Das. The movie never gives any details on what is his capability? 
The only capability we see is that he is a drunkard. Even to an extent that he has to sell his wife's jeweler. 
Even in the beginning of movie he admits that he is a glorified coolie. Any little discouragement and he goes 
into drinking and smoking. Why in this world is the parsi gentleman having faith on him? At least the audience 
doesn't get any clue. And that too 2ce? Given me I won't give him a dime. So the only credibility that someone is
a genius is to drink and smoke? This is lame. What is with the leg show from Tapan? Seriously. 
Is this a lame comedy attempt. By the way why mock Buddhist monks? Just uttering some ones name is 
not good enough to break their vow. Joking is good, but not on a national scale. Have some respect. 
In general there is no substance with the movie. Not worth spending a dime on this movie.
