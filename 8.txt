This was just a shoddy attempt to bring patriotism in a hockey movie. Very unrealistic, 
unconvincing and poorly made. Akki is a good actor, but here he's just all over the place with his acting. 
Was he acting as a Bengali who can sing in Punjabi or a Punjabi mocking Bengali accent throughout the film; 
and also he's all over the place in the film (coach+manager+financer+team selector+scouter, did I miss any? 
Apart from a moment when he was picking up teams luggage as a cookie) At any moment if Akki had come to score a goal, 
I wouldn't have been surprised. I mean, c'mon director Saab, we're not so dumb. Rest of main characters have done 
their work well enough.
Now, Comparison with another similar hockey based film is called for. Without going into details, 
it's no were near the art, skills, patriotism, emotional value and sincerity of Chak De.
