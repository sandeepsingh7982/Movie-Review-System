The best movie of 2018 . Great job done by Reema kagti because of her we were able 
to watch such a wonderful movie with such great direction. As we come to acting no 
other actor can match versitality of Akshay kumar he was just awesome. I loved the 
character of sunny Kaushal (himmat) he has done a great job. Amit sadh was also good . 
There are many scenes which give you goosebumps but the climax will bring tears in your eyes 
it's a very proud moment for all of us. Just watch it you will love it.
