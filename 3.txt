This Movie tells the Story of the Journey of Indian Hockey Team from British Era to Free-India. 
It feels like we are in those days. Simply awesome Screenplay, Dialogues and Background Score.
 Akshay Kumar did a great job there in his role. Kunal Kapoor is Awesome as he is. 
The role of Himmat Singh Played by Sunny Kaushal is the USP of this movie. For me, After a Long Time,
Good movie to watch on This Independence Day.
