Akshay Kumar is in its best form and giving superhits one after another. 
I am surprised that how could a man get so much well written script. 
Amit sadh is very underrated and a very good actor he proves that. 
Kunal Roy Kapoor and Vineet Singh is truly a gem Sunny Kaushal is the surprise
package and really a turrup ka ikka in both acting and movie Direction of Reema kagti 
is very concerned not a single dull moment. She had a tight screenplay So, finally Gold is 
a very well crafted film and the last 30 minutes should surely give goosebumps to every indian
