When one have a story more precious than gold, then one needs to make sure that it's not always about making money. 
By taking an actor like Akshay, whose slapstick comedy films r simply making money, 
then it shows that the producers were just greedy to cash in on the success of the star value. 
Rather than paying attention on the screenplay n direction, it all became melodramatic with Akshay's repeated overacting. 
All the other good actors were sidelined. Unnecessary romantic story, with unnecessary songs. 
I was wondering did I pay to c the biopic on the historical win or a coach's story fabricated with too much melodrama n overacting.
