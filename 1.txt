If want to see something on this Independence Day then Gold is the perfect film for that. 
There is no greater pride in sport than to see your country's flag being hoisted in international stage.
Starting of the movie is bit slow but it will become interesting in later half. 
In one word your sentiment for the country will be amplified for sure. Acting of Akshay Kumar is awesome.
He justified the charecter Tapan Das. But some of the historical fact is changed to dramatize the film. 
The journey of Indian hockey team to London Olympic 1948 is different than in the film. 
Mouni Roy did a good job in her charecter. You will feel thrill at the end of the film. 
Critics reviews for this film is bad but I personally thinks its a good movie with patrism in it.
