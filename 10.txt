I'll just say if you should go to watch the movie or not. The answer is it will be 
a crime if you miss this. You have to watch this for its researches on very small 
things of that era, which is the most important for a period movie; 
appropriate acting of the whole supporting cast; Akshay Kumar's unbelievable performance 
of comedy, disappointment, a drunk man, victory & strategies; an extraordinary background music; 
unheard classic victory of India once upon a time; perfectly showcased World War II, 
communal battles & aboveall lessons of unity to conquer Gold. Monobina & Chad Gayi Hai- 
things get upside down after these two songs. You can't think of the twist after the songs, 
so just enjoy the songs, the film will have a twist then. Rasta Rasta & Khel Khel Mein are 
my favourite two tracks that helps the movie to go forward. Don't compare Chak De & Gold. 
Chak De teaches us about women empowerment, SRK's challenge against them who told him 'Gaddar'. 
But Gold is the story of new born & about to be born India, making of the whole team to stand 
against Brittish. Only similarity between the two is hockey & some hockey related strategies. 
So, SRK's fans, don't offend with Gold. Because Gold is a different movie & not only about hockey. It is much more.
