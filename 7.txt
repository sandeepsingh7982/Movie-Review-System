Average movie. Akshay kumar tries hard to act but he has his limitations. 
Distorted history and added too much drama. Second half is faster than first one. 
Very cheap attempt to make a movie hit (either target pakistan or british)
When we'd rise up from it and make another chak de india which has no cheap tactics 
or even stupid commercial elements to make it a hit.
