Reema Kagti deserves the first mention here. She has created an absolute gem,
a well balanced plot and an amazing script which has comedy, emotions and Patriotism in the right amount. 
Akshay Kumar is mind blowing! He nails each and every aspect of his character. 
His screen presence is something that cannot be missed and the mini monologue he gives before the climax scene is awesome.
Sunny Kaushal is a surprise package! Just like his brother Vicky, he amazes the audience with his performance as Himmat. 
Kunal Kapoor, Amit Saadh and Vineet Singh have also done a brilliant job! The film keeps you engaged and 
sticked to your seats, the one liners are genuinely funny and definitely increase the entertainment aspect. 
Last 10-15 minutes of the film are the best! From the semi final till the climax scene there are a lot of Goosebumps! 
Music is average but work well with the film as most of the songs are situational. Naino Ne Baandhi and Rasta Rasta are 
a treat to hear in the theatre. Overall the film is a perfect blend of Patriotism and Entertainment. Go for Gold
